/**
 * Which seconds of a video a user has actually played, as a bitset.
 *
 * One bit per second: bit N set means second N was played. Marking the same
 * range twice sets the same bits, so re-watching contributes nothing — the
 * "you can't count those seconds again" rule is a property of the structure
 * rather than logic layered on top.
 *
 * Ranges are HALF-OPEN [from, to): mark(0, 5) covers seconds 0,1,2,3,4. That
 * is what makes two disjoint five-second stretches total exactly ten, and
 * what stops 0-5 followed by 5-10 from counting second 5 twice.
 *
 * Size is bounded by duration no matter how erratically someone scrubs:
 * ceil(duration / 8) bytes. A 15-minute video is 113 bytes.
